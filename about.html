      <h3>what is "matthew"</h3>

      <p>
        hello! i'm matthew hrehirchuk. i'm a computer information system student
        at <a href="https://www.mtroyal.ca/">mount royal university</a> in
        calgary, alberta, canada. i make lots of games, a few helpful tools, and
        at the moment, lots of studying resources for students like myself.
      </p>

      <h3>my history</h3>
      <p>
        my programming journey started waaaay back in middle school. i found out
        that google sheets had a "scripts" menu that was unrestricted for
        students - even on shared documents. i ended up allocating a ton of my
        time into learning how to make scripts for google docs and google
        sheets, and i ended up accidentally learning the fundamentals of
        programming. whoops. i ended up making a ton of fun projects in google
        sheets, things like group randomizers, maze games, fun stuff like that.
      </p>
      <h3>games</h3>
      <p>
        tail end of middle school, i caught wind of a programming competition
        called <a href="ldjam.com">ludum dare</a>: 48 hours to make a game from
        scratch, based off a voted theme. i partnered with my buddy connell and
        my cousin evan, and we ended up making a platformer mixed with a text
        adventure for ludum dare 41. this game is now lost to time, as i cannot
        find it. connell, if you're reading this, please let me know if you have
        a copy of platSCII.
      </p>
      <p>
        that project, i ended up taking the role of the artist. i was
        <i>fine</i> at it, but i really struggled with now having control over
        the programming aspect of things, and not being able to tweak things to
        my liking - we were working in unity, an engine i wasn't (and still am
        not) familiar with. i ended up investing some time learning gamemaker
        studio, and started doing jams on my own. put out a bunch of great
        games, met some great people, and ended up running the
        <a href="https://discord.gg/ucGcvKK">ludum dare discord server</a>. i've
        personally run a few jams myself, and have only won one.
      </p>

      <h3>web dev</h3>
      <p>
        also near the end of middle school, i enrolled in an "intro to
        programming" option. it sucked, big time. the teacher had no idea how to
        teach programming, and we all ended up on some crappy website to
        practically teach ourselves. luckily, i had some experience, and a dad
        who knew how to get ubuntu and apache running on an old laptop. i ended
        up building a chat client from the ground up: front end, all styled, php
        backend with a mysql database. was also lost to time, unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
        ended up doing some more web dev in high school, mostly working with js.
        near the end of high school, i started working with react and bootstrap
        to try and get an internship. got one, just not with react. nowadays
        i'll use react with tailwind to whip up some quick projects.
