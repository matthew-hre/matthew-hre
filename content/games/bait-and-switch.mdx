Made for [Alberta Game Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/alberta-game-jam-2023), "bait & switch" is a wild departure from my usual style. It's a top down shooter with roguelike elements, where you catch bugs in your net and throw them at other bugs to kill them. It's a lot of fun, and I'm really proud of it. I'm planning some further development on it, including some quality of life features, some new upgrades, and hopefully a boss fight, so stay tuned!
