This was **yet another** internal jam submission, but this time I won. This platformer was inspired by [the Rorschach Inkblot test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test), and the gameplay followed a similar concept. you needed to use ink to reveal parts of the map.

This game went on to get a [Steam release](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1499210/Rorschach_Plus/) by my good buddy [EmCannon](https://emcannon.itch.io), so give that a look.
