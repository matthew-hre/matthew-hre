## Project Summary

A departure from my usual Godot / GameMaker projects, Sender Not Found was my first shot at a horror-esque game. It was made in React, since I felt out of practice with my usual engines, and I wanted to try something new.

## Results

This is one of my highest ranking Ludum Dare submissions to date, placing 58th overall, 20th in innovation, and 10th in mood. I was pretty happy to see a project I designed to be creepy actually be creepy.
