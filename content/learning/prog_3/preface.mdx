This series of articles, originally designed as a quick refresher for people looking to remember how to write Java code, has evolved into a full-fledged series of articles, references, resources, and exercises. This used to be a massive, single web page, but it has been broken up into smaller, more manageable pages.

This series of articles is updated regularly. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me on Discord, in person in B103, or via email at mhreh594\@mtroyal.ca.
