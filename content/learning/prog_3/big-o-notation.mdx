Big O Notation is a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm.
We'll be using it to compare the efficiency of different sorting and
searching algorithms.

## What is Big O Notation?

Big O Notation is a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm. It's a way to describe how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the size of the input changes. It's important to note that Big O Notation describes the _worst case_ runtime of an algorithm.

Let's look at an example. Here's a function that prints the numbers `1` through `n`:

```java
public void printNumbers(int n) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}
```

The runtime of this function is `O(n)`, or linear. This means that the runtime of the function increases linearly as the size of the input increases. If we double the size of the input, the runtime will double.

We can determine that the Big O Notation of this function is `O(n)` by looking at the for loop. The for loop will run `n` times, so the runtime of the function is `O(n)`.

Let's look at another example. Here's a function that prints the numbers `1` through `n`, then prints the numbers `1` through `n` again:

```java
public void printNumbersTwice(int n) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}
```

Even though this function has two for loops, the runtime is still `O(n)`. Let's break it down.

1. The first for loop iterates from `1` to `n` once, and each iteration involves a constant-time operation (printing the value of `i`). So, the time complexity of the first for loop is `O(n)`.

2. Similarly, the second for loop also iterates from `1` to `n` once and performs constant-time operations (printing the value of `i`). So, the time complexity of the second for loop is also `O(n)`.

3. Since the two for loops are executed sequentially (one after the other), we simply add their time complexities together. Therefore, the overall time complexity of our method is `O(n) + O(n) = O(2n)`.

4. But wait! Since we drop the constants in Big O Notation, the overall time complexity of our method is `O(2n) = O(n)`.

Finally, let's take a look at a function that draws a square with hashtags. The size of the square is determined by the input `n`.

```java
public void drawSquare(int n) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      System.out.print("#");
    }
    System.out.println();
  }
}
```

The runtime of this function is `O(n^2)`, or quadratic. This means that the runtime of the function increases quadratically as the size of the input increases. If we double the size of the input, the runtime will quadruple.

We can determine that the Big O Notation of this function is `O(n^2)` by looking at the nested for loops. The outer for loop will run n times, and the inner for loop will run n times for each iteration of the outer for loop. So, the runtime of the function is `O(n^2)`.

## Big O Notation Practice

I'll give you a few functions, and you tell me the Big O Notation of each one. Here's the first one:

```java
public void printNumbers(int n) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}
```

Here's the second one:

```java
public void printNumbersButDifferent(int n) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
  }
  for (int j = n; j >= 1; j--) {
    System.out.println(j);
  }
}
```

Here's the third one:

```java
public void bigSmilesAllAround(int n) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        System.out.print(":)");
      }
      System.out.println();
    }
    System.out.println();
  }
}
```

Here's the fourth one:

```java
public void printNiceGreeting(int n) {
  System.out.println("What's up buttercup?");
}
```

Here's the fifth one:

```java
public void printNumbersWeirdly(int n) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i = i * 2) { // hehe, good luck
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}
```
