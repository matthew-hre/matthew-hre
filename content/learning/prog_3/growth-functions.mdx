## What are Growth Functions?

Growth Functions are used to describe the runtime of an algorithm. They're used to describe how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the size of the input changes. Here's an example:

```java
public void printNumbers(int n) {
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}
```

Let's walk through this function. The function takes in an integer `n`. Then, it loops from `1` to `n`, printing each number. So, if we pass in `5`, the function will print the numbers `1` through `5`. If we pass in `10`, the function will print the numbers `1` through `10`. You get the idea.

Therefore, the growth function of this function is `T(n) = n`. This means that the runtime of the function increases linearly as the size of the input increases. If we double the size of the input, the runtime will double.

## Growth Function Rules

There are a few rules that we need to follow when writing growth functions:

### 1. Consecutive Program Statements

If we have two program statements that are executed one after the other, we can add their growth functions together

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
// This is the first program statement. It has a growth function of T(n)1 = 1.

while (x < y) {
  // This is the second program statement. It has a growth function of T(n)2 = n.
  x++;
}

// The growth function of the two program statements is T(n)1 + T(n)2.
// In this case, T(n)1 + T(n)2 = 1 + n = n + 1, which is T(n) = n + 2.
```

### 2. Nested Program Statements

If we have two program statements that are nested inside each other, we can multiply their growth functions together

```java
while(x > 0) { // Let's call this loop "m"
  while(y > 0) { // Let's call this loop "n"
    // This is the program statement. It has a growth function of T(n) = 1.
    y--;
  }
  // The growth function of the two program statements is T(n) = m * n.
  // In this case, T(n) = m * n = n * n = n^2.
  x--;
}
```

### 3. If Statements

If we have an if statement, we need to take the growth function of the conditional itself, added to the maximum growth function of the two possible paths

```java
if (x > 2) { // Here's our T(n)1. In this case, it's T(n)1 = 1.
  // Here's our T(n)2. In this case, it's T(n)2 = n.
  while (x > 0) {
    x--;
  }
} else {
  // Here's our T(n)3. In this case, it's T(n)3 = n^2.
  while (x > 0) {
    while (y > 0) {
      y--;
    }
    x--;
  }
}

// The growth function of the if statement is T(n)1 + max(T(n)2, T(n)3).
```

It's important to note that we are writing out that whole `max` thing. We're not just taking the maximum growth function of the two possible paths. We're taking the maximum growth function of the two possible paths, and adding it to the growth function of the conditional itself. This is especially important when we're dealing with exponential growth functions. Consider, for example, if I have the growth functions `T(n) = 2n^3` and `T(n) = 3n^2`. You'd clearly say "oh, of course the thing to the third power is bigger," right? But, when plugging in small values, for instance, `1`, `2`, and `3`, the thing to the third power is actually smaller. So, we need to take the whole `max` thing into account.

### 4. Method Calls

If we have a method call, we need to take the growth function of the method itself, added to the growth function of the parameters

```java
public void printNumbers(int n) { // Here's our T(n)1. In this case, it's T(n)1 = n.
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
  }
}

public void printNumbersTwice(int n) { // Here's our T(n)2. In this case, it's T(n)2 = 2n.
  printNumbers(n); // Here, we call the printNumbers method. T(n) = n.
  printNumbers(n); // Hold on! Here, we call the printNumbers method again. T(n) = n.
  // The growth function of these two method calls is T(n) = n + n = 2n.
}
```

## Calculating Growth Functions - A Rule of Thumb

Here's my technique for calculating growth functions. I'll walk you through it with an example.

Let's say we have the following code:

```java
public void funcTronic(int n) {
  int num1 = 0;
  int num2 = 0;

  for ( int count = 0; count < n; count += 3) {
    if ( ( count % 2) == 0) {
      for ( int count2 = 0; count2 < n; count2 += 2) {
        for ( int count3 = n; count3 > 0; count3--) {
          num1++;
          num2 += num1;
        }
      }
    } else {
      for ( int count4 = 0; count4 < n; count4++) {
        num1++;
        num2 += num1;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Yikes. That's a lot of code. Let's break down my approach to calculating the growth function.

First, whenever the next line of the code is at the **same level of indentation**, I add the growth functions together. So, let's start with the first two lines:

```java
int num1 = 0; // T(n) = 1
int num2 = 0; // T(n) = 1
// T(n) = 1 + 1 = 2
```

Easy. Next, whenever the level of indentation **increases**, I multiply the growth functions together. Think of it as opening a bracket before multiplying, and closing a bracket after multiplying. So, let's look at the next line:

```java
// Remember, we've started with T(n) = 2.

for ( int count = 0; count < n; count += 3) { // T(n) = n/3
  // We're now at T(n) = 2 + (n/3).

  if ( ( count % 2) == 0) { // We indented! Open a bracket!!!
    // T(n) = 2 + (n/3)(max(...
    for ( int count2 = 0; count2 < n; count2 += 2) { // T(n) = n/2
      for ( int count3 = n; count3 > 0; count3--) {  // T(n) = n
        num1++;       // Both of these are T(n) = 1
        num2 += num1; // which makes this T(n) = 1 + 1 = 2
      }
    }

    // This section of the code is T(n) = n/2 * n * 2 = n^2.

  } else {
    for ( int count4 = 0; count4 < n; count4++) { // T(n) = n
      num1++;       // Once again, both of these are T(n) = 1
      num2 += num1; // which makes this T(n) = 1 + 1 = 2
    }

    // This section of the code is T(n) = n * 2 = 2n.
  }
}

// Finally, we can put everything together. We have T(n) = 2 + (n/3)(max(n^2, 2n)).
```

Woof.
