## What are Comparables?

Comparables are interfaces that are used to compare objects. They're used to define a method that compares two objects. Here's an example:

```java
public class Person implements Comparable<Person> {
  // In order to implement the Comparable interface, we need to overload
  // the compareTo method. This is how we tell Java how to compare two
  // Person objects.
  public int compareTo(Person otherPerson) {
    // Compare the two Person objects
    // Return -1 if this Person is less than otherPerson
    // Return 0 if this Person is equal to otherPerson
    // Return 1 if this Person is greater than otherPerson
  }
}
```

Notice how we return a number between -1 and 1? This is how we can use the built-in `Collections.sort()` method. Here's an example:

```java
// Create an ArrayList of Person objects
ArrayList<Person> people = new ArrayList<Person>();

// Add some Person objects to the ArrayList
people.add(new Person("Jaunie", 20));
people.add(new Person("Sunny", 18));
people.add(new Person("Riley", 25));

// Sort the ArrayList
Collections.sort(people);

// Print the sorted ArrayList
System.out.println(people);
```

Easy peasy. But what if we want to sort the ArrayList in a different way? What if we want to sort the ArrayList by age, or by name? We can use the `Comparator` interface to do that. Here's an example:

```java
// Create a Comparator that sorts by age
Comparator<Person> ageComparator = new Comparator<Person>() {
  // In order to implement the Comparator interface, we need to overload
  // the compare method. This is how we tell Java how to compare two
  // Person objects.
  public int compare(Person person1, Person person2) {
    // Compare the two Person objects
    // Return -1 if person1 is less than person2
    // Return 0 if person1 is equal to person2
    // Return 1 if person1 is greater than person2
  }
};
```

## Comparables and Comparators Practice

Let's practice using Comparables and Comparators. Let's create a `Book` class that has three properties, `title`, `author`, and `year`. Then, let's create a `Comparator` that sorts by all three properties. If you'd like a further challenge, create a `Comparator` that sorts by a single property, and a `Comparator` that sorts by two properties!

Now, we can use the `Collections.sort()` method to sort the ArrayList by age. Here's an example:

```java
// Create an ArrayList of Person objects
ArrayList<Person> people = new ArrayList<Person>();

// Add some Person objects to the ArrayList
people.add(new Person("Jaunie", 20));
people.add(new Person("Sunny", 18));
people.add(new Person("Riley", 25));

// Sort the ArrayList by age
// Note the second parameter, where we pass in our Comparator
Collections.sort(people, ageComparator);
```
