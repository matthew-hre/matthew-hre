## Variables and Math

I'll burn through this section quickly, as it's mostly review. If you need a refresher on any of this, check out the [Java Basics](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_variables.asp) page on W3Schools.

### Variables

Variables are used to store information in a program. They can be used to store numbers, text, or other data types. In Java, variables are declared with a type and a name. Here's pretty much every data type in Java that we care about:

```java
int myInt = 5;
double myDouble = 5.99;
float myFloat = 5.99f;
char myChar = 'A';
String myString = "Hello";
boolean myBool = true;
```

### Math

Of course, we can do math in Java. Here are the basic operators and some
methods you'll probably use:

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 3;

// Addition
int sum = x + y;

// Subtraction
int difference = x - y;

// Multiplication
int product = x * y;

// Division
int quotient = x / y;

// Modulus
int remainder = x % y;

// Absolute Value
int absoluteValue = Math.abs(x);

// Square Root
double squareRoot = Math.sqrt(x);

// Random Number
double randomNumber = Math.random();
```

## Conditionals and Loops

Once again, this is mostly review. If you need a refresher, check out the [Java Conditions](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_conditions.asp) and [Java Loops](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_while_loop.asp) pages on W3Schools.

### Conditionals

Conditionals are used to make decisions in a program. They allow us to run different code depending on the value of a variable. Here are the basic conditional operators:

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 3;

if (x == y) {
  // Do something
} else if (x > y) {
  // Do something else
} else {
  // Do something else
}
```

### Switch Statements

Switch statements are a special type of conditional that allow us to check the value of a variable against a list of possible values. Here's an example:

```java
int day = 4;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    // This is how we output text in Java, by the way
    System.out.println("Monday");
    break; // This is how we end a case
  case 2:
    System.out.println("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    System.out.println("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    System.out.println("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    System.out.println("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    System.out.println("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    System.out.println("Sunday");
    break;
  default: // This is what happens if none of the cases match
    System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
```

### Loops

Loops are used to repeat code. There are three main types of loops in Java: `for` loops, `while` loops, and `do...while` loops. Here's an example of each:

```java
/*
    For loops are defined with three parts:
    1. The initialization of the loop variable
    2. The condition that the loop variable must meet to continue looping
    3. The change to the loop variable after each iteration
*/
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}

/*
    While loops are defined with a single condition. The loop will continue
    looping as long as the condition is true.
*/
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}

/*
    Do...while loops are defined with a single condition. The loop will
    continue looping as long as the condition is true. The difference between
    a do...while loop and a while loop is that a do...while loop will always
    run at least once.
*/

int i = 0;
do {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

## Arrays and ArrayLists

Arrays and ArrayLists are used to store lists of data. Arrays are fixed in size, while ArrayLists can grow and shrink. Here's how to declare and use them:

```java
// Arrays

// This is how we declare an array
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};

// If we want the first element in the array, we use the index 0
System.out.println(cars[0]); // Volvo

// If we want to change the first element in the array, we use the index 0
cars[0] = "Opel";

// If we want to get the length of the array, we use the length property
System.out.println(cars.length); // 4

// Arrays without predefined values are declared like this
String[] newCars = new String[4];
```

Keep in mind that Arrays are fixed in size. If you want to add or remove elements from an array, you'll need to create a new array with the correct size and copy the elements over. If you like being all loosey-goosey with your data, you can use an ArrayList instead. Here's how to declare and use an ArrayList:

```java
// ArrayLists

// This is how we declare an ArrayList
ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();

// This is how we add an element to the ArrayList
cars.add("Volvo");

// This is how we get an element from the ArrayList
System.out.println(cars.get(0)); // Volvo

// This is how we change an element in the ArrayList
cars.set(0, "Opel");

// This is how we get the length of the ArrayList
System.out.println(cars.size()); // 1
```

## File I/O and Exceptions

### File I/O

File I/O is used to read and write files. Here's an example of reading a file:

```java
try {
  // Create a file object
  File myObj = new File("filename.txt");
  // Create a scanner object
  Scanner myReader = new Scanner(myObj);
  // Read the file
  while (myReader.hasNextLine()) {
    // Print each line
    String data = myReader.nextLine();
    System.out.println(data);
  }
  myReader.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) { // We'll talk about exceptions later
  System.out.println("An error occurred.");
  e.printStackTrace();
}
```

We're also able to write to files. Here's an example:

```java
try {
  // Create a file object
  FileWriter myWriter = new FileWriter("filename.txt");
  // Write to the file
  myWriter.write("Files in Java might be tricky, but it is fun enough!");
  // Close the file
  myWriter.close();
  System.out.println("Successfully wrote to the file.");
} catch (IOException e) { // We'll talk about exceptions later
  System.out.println("An error occurred.");
  e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### Exceptions

Exceptions are used to handle errors in Java. All exceptions are subclasses of the `Exception` class. Here's an example of how to handle an exception:

```java
try {
  // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (Exception e) {
  // Code to handle the exception
}
```

We're also able to throw our own exceptions. Here's an example:

```java
// This is how we throw an exception
throw new Exception("Something went wrong");
```

And, of course, we can create our own exceptions. Here's an example:

```java
// This is how we create a custom exception
class MyException extends Exception {
  public MyException(String errorMessage) {
    super(errorMessage);
  }
}

// This is how we throw a custom exception
throw new MyException("Something went wrong");
```

## Classes and Objects

Here's where we may need a little refresher. If you need a refresher, check out the [Java Classes and Objects](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_classes.asp) page on W3Schools.

### Classes

Classes are used to define objects. They contain the properties and methods that objects of that class will have. Here's an example of a class:

```java
public class Car {
  // This is a property of the Car class
  String color = "red";

  // This is a method of the Car class
  public void drive() {
    System.out.println("The car is driving");
  }
}
```

### Objects

Objects are instances of a class. They have the properties and methods defined in the class. Here's an example of an object:

```java
// This is how we create an object of the Car class
Car myCar = new Car();

// This is how we access the properties of the Car class
System.out.println(myCar.color); // red

// This is how we access the methods of the Car class
myCar.drive(); // The car is driving
```

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a way to create a new class that inherits the properties and methods of another class. Here's an example:

```java

// This is the parent class
public class Animal {
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("The animal is eating");
  }
}

// This is the child class
public class Dog extends Animal {
  public void bark() {
    System.out.println("The dog is barking");
  }
}

// This is how we create an object of the Dog class
Dog myDog = new Dog();

// This is how we access the inherited methods of the Animal class
myDog.eat(); // The animal is eating

// and, of course, the methods of the Dog class
myDog.bark(); // The dog is barking
```

## Abstract Classes

Abstract classes are classes that can't be instantiated. They're used to define a base class that other classes can extend. Here's an example:

```java
// This is an abstract class.
abstract class Animal {
  // This is an abstract method. It doesn't have a body.
  public abstract void eat();

  // This is a normal method
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("The animal is making a sound");
  }
}

// This is a class that extends the Animal class
class Cat extends Animal {
  public void eat() {
    System.out.println("The cat is eating");
  }
}
```

It's important to note that a class can only extend one class. If you want to extend multiple classes, you'll need to use interfaces.
