Since it looks like Massoud wants us to fiddle with the terminal in this course, I wanted to put out a PSA to any Mac users out there: [Stop Using Terminal.App](https://x.com/mitchellh/status/1730101257065640372). Seriously. It's not good.

Right now, I think that [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) is the best terminal emulator for Mac. It's fast, it's free, it's open source, and it feels native (because it is). ITerm2 is also a good choice, but it's not as fast as Ghostty.

Lukewarm take here, but I think that [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is the best code editor for web development. The plugin ecosystem is pretty sweet, and you've probably already used it. If you're feeling bougie, you could also check out [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

And, of course, if you want to manage your development environments, I will champion [Nix](https://nixos.org) until the day I die. It's the toughest learning curve of the bunch, but it's so worth it. Check out how I use Nix [here](https://matthew-hre.com/blog/nix-and-nixos).
