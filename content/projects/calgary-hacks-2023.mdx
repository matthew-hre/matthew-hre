## Winner winner, chicken dinner

[Calgary Hacks](https://calgaryhacks.ca/) is a yearly hackathon hosted by the University of Calgary. A couple of us Mount Royal students came into their house, and absolutely cleaned up. First place in the first division. RoomWise allows students to see the spaces that can be used for studying on a map and set up regular meetings for study groups, partner assignments, or clubs. Students can sort rooms based on accessibility, noise level, floor, and capacity and view recurring study groups.
