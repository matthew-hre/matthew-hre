# MRUHacks Library Display

![](/images/mruhacks-library-display/image.png)

For MRUHacks 2024, we wanted to go all out. As a fun little side project, I designed and developed an interactive photo wall! This wall displayed a live countdown of when the event ended, all our social QR codes, a live calendar of events, and a regularly updated wall of photos.

The reason this project gets a post on the website, and doesn't just collect dust in my file system, is because I *need* to tell someone about how I hacked together the image loading.

In order to have my team send photos to the wall, I created a shared Google Drive folder, which I refreshed every thirty minutes in order to scrape the photos and display them on the wall. In order to avoid setting up an S3 bucket, I had to create a custom API route for querying a Google Drive folder of all the photos in it, and grabbed the high-quality version of those photos.

After the event, I went and overhauled the code base to make it easier to use in the future. All the configuration is broken out into a `photowall.config.ts` file, and is easily customizable for the future.
