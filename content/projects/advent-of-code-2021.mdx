My participation in [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) in JavaScript. Every day, you get a new puzzle, and you have to solve it. Unique inputs and solutions per user, was a whole lot of fun. Did not get far, because [Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) is the worst.
