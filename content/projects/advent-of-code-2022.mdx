I attempted Advent of Code 2022 in Python. This time, I had created a boilerplate class that would automatically grab my puzzle input from the site, as well as did some cool stuff like output formatting. Also, did not get far, because [Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) is still the worst.
