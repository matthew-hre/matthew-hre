## Advent of Code 2023

This year I once again decided to participate in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event. I've been doing it for a few years now, and it's always a fun challenge. I'm not going to post my solutions here, but I will share some thoughts on the event and how I approached it.

## My Approach

My very first AOC was 2021, where I managed to get 25 stars. That was all done in JavaScript, and I was quite happy with my performance. Last year, I decided to do it in Python, and I got 17 stars. This year, I also did it in Python, and I got a whopping 31 stars! I'm very happy with that result, and I think it's a testament to how much I've improved as a programmer over the past few years.

This year was a little different, as I had some company. My buddy [Thomas](https://kapocsi.ca) and I both camped out on campus every night and worked on the puzzles together. It was a lot of fun, and I think it helped keep me motivated and focused. There are plenty of times where I would have given up if I was working alone, but having someone else there to bounce ideas off of and commiserate with made a big difference.
