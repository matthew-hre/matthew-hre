## @everyone, we're hosting a hackathon

After winning Calgary Hacks 2023, we decided to host our own hackathon at Mount Royal University. We - we being Sunny, Jaunie and myself, mostly Sunny - spent months planning this event, and were so excited to see what everyone built. We received a ton of support from the community, the school, and the faculty, and we're really excited to, hopefully, make this a reoccurring event for future students.

## The Website

I'm not gonna say this is the best website I've ever built, but it's pretty good. I'm a pretty heavy brutalist when it comes to web design, and this isn't really my usual style, but I'm really happy with how professional it looks. I'm also really happy with how it scales across devices, and how it looks on mobile. I'm not a huge fan of mobile-first design, but I think when we're talking about students, it's good to assume that they're gonna be on their phones.

The website was built with React, with all custom CSS. I'm not a huge fan of CSS frameworks when it comes to my own projects, since my designs are usually pretty simple, and I don't like having to fight with the framework to get it to do what I want. This project, however, would have probably been a lot easier with Tailwind, but I'm happy with how it turned out. It was fun trying to tweak the CSS to get it to look right, and I'm really happy with how it turned out.
