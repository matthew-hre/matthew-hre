## Still Kickin' It

Woof. Long time no see. I've been wickedly busy recently and just have *not* had the time to post anything. Thought I'd take the time now to give a quick update of what I'd been working on, and what's to come.

## MRUHacks 2024

Remember last year how I helped run a hackathon? This year, we're going big rather than home. [MRUHacks 2024](https://mruhacks.ca) is now open to **all post-secondary institutions**, and we're expecting a huge turn out. Our organizing team is 20ish people, all focused on running one of the best student tech events in Calgary.

Now, because of this, I haven't looked a code in a hot minute. In fact, I've been instructed to not touch any code relating to the hackathon, which has felt like some weird form of torture. But, I've been able to focus on other things, like school and work. Who are we kidding, it's all hackathon.

## Hackifier

### HackPortal

When I went down to Texas for HackUTD X, they were using a sweet little tool called HackPortal for their event management. Instead of doing what most of Calgary does for their hackathons - ancient technology such as physical meal tickets and Google Forms - they had a whole system in place for managing their event. Participants would apply on the website, be given a QR code to check in, and then they could check in at the event with their QR code. It was a pretty sweet system, and I wanted to bring it to Calgary.

For MRUHacks 2024, we're using HackPortal. It's a great system, but I've got a few gripes. First, customizability is a little rough. I can't change the front end without touching the code, and the application form has to be a set number of pages. Next, I just can't do as much as I want to with it! I'd love to be able to manage my mentors and judges, and have a more comprehensive ticketing system. Finally, and most importantly, judging is a whole other system! They have a whole separate tool called Gavel they use! I want to be able to manage everything from one place.

### Masochism

So, I've decided to build my own event management tool. I'm calling it Hackifier. It's going to be a comprehensive event management tool, with a no-code customizable front end, participant application system, push notifications, QR code check in, comprehensive ticketing system, calendar, diverse permissions system, admin console, judging system, *deep breath*, and a mentor coordination system. It's going to be a lot of work, but I think it'll be worth it. The dream is to use it for MRUHacks 2025, but we'll see how that goes.

## What Else, What Else?

I mean, this website is still running pretty strong. I'm really happy with the way this page looks and feels, and I'm excited to keep working on it. I've got a few ideas for some new features, but those are cemented to the back burner until I get Hackifier up and running. I've also got a few other projects I'm working on, but those are all secret for now. I'll let you know when I can.

Also, if you're reading this and have a couple bucks burning a hole in your pocket, consider sponsoring MRUHacks 2024. We're a student-run event, and we're always looking for sponsors to help us out. You can find more information on our [website](https://mruhacks.ca). Help us run one of the coolest events in Calgary.
