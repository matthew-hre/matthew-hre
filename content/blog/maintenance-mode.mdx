I've had a website since 2019 — almost seven years now.

Back then, it was just a catalog of my work, a way to share what I'd created. I used it to share my thoughts and progress as I learned. I'm still really proud of that early work!

Since 15-year-old me built this site, a lot has happened. I graduated high school, moved out, ran events, worked various jobs, moved back in, switched operating systems, and more. My work and skillset has evolved, along with this site. I went from a kid figuring out how to make a website, to someone building — or trying to build — a career in tech.

Lately I played around with a new design — fancy animations, esoteric typefaces, etc. But that was just surface-level polish on an incomplete site. The posts were half-baked, images were basically non-existent, and my Advent of Code articles were nothing more than GitHub links.

Over the next few months, I'm going to review everything and rebuild the parts that matter. Many projects here feel unfinished or outdated. I plan to work on projects that really matter to me, and replace old content with something that reflects who I am now.

What is this process gonna look like? Over time you'll hopefully see new content popping up — whether that's a rebuilt hackathon project with a full case study, or a clear, well-written post about a new technology I'm picking up or an experience I've had. I want this site to show who I am today and really reflect that evolution.

Maintenance mode usually means letting something slowly fade away, like some old legacy system. This isn't that. It's more like a rebirth. I'm proud of how far I've come since 15-year-old me posted that first HTML page, and I can almost feel how stoked that little guy is for this next chapter.

I'm not purging everything quite yet. I know a bunch of people rely on my Prog III notes to make it through that class, and I don't want to take that away from them. So, for now, here's some links to the content that's staying up:
