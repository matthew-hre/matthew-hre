## Sorry, Missed A Couple...

> This article has been migrated over from the old website, and may refer to content that is no longer relevant to the current website.

Hello September! It's been a hectic couple of months, and I've missed a handful of updates. I've been working on a couple of projects, some of which I can finally start sharing, so strap in!

MRUHacks is Mount Royal University's newest hackathon, running this October 13th-14th! I've been working on the website for the hackathon for the past couple of months, and well as the posters and other promotional material. We're really excited to be hosting this event, and we're hoping to get a lot of students involved. If you're interested in participating, or just seeing the website, you can check it out here.

Alberta Game Jam happened! I was really excited to get involved with this one, and I'm really happy with how it turned out. I only had about half the time to work on it, but I managed to get a game done. You can check it out here. There's also a post-mortem on the game here.

If you're a recruiter or someone looking to hire me, welcome! Take a peek at some projects of mine and play a couple of my games. If you're interested in working with me, contact me! I'm always looking for Ludum Dare teammates.

## Website Updates

- Sweet Nothin' has been added as of recent. Sorry.

## Plans for world domination Expansion

- **Threaded Posts** are in the works, and will allow pages like this to load several articles at once, and display them in a threaded format. This will allow me to write articles like this one, and have them all displayed on the same page, rather than having to make a new page for each one. Maybe I'll even hook an RSS feed up to it, who knows?
- **AI Generated Resume**. Instead of having some pdf download, I want to be able to have users select the skills they're interested in and have the resume dynamically update to show off those skills. OpenAI has a neat little API that might be able to help with this.
- **Spotify Listening History**, as nerdy as that sounds, is something I thought would be really neat to have. Maybe display my current song in the header, or show my listening history somewhere. Just something to show off my API skills.
