## NextJS Transition Underway!

> This article has been migrated over from the old website, and may refer to content that is no longer relevant to the current website.

I've been working on transitioning this website to NextJS, and I'm really excited about it. I've been working on a lot of projects lately, and I'm hoping to get them all up on the website soon. I've also been working on a lot of backend stuff, so I'm hoping to get some of that up soon as well.

MRUHacks happened, and was a huge success! I was so happy to be part of the organizing team, and I'm really proud of what we were able to accomplish. I'm really excited to see what the future holds for MRUHacks, and I'm really looking forward to the next one.

MRU Game Design and Development Club is still going strong, and we're working on a lot of really cool events. Most recently, we ran a social event, and we're planning on a pixel art workshop soon.

If you're a recruiter or someone looking to hire me, welcome! Take a peek at some projects of mine and play a couple of my games. If you're interested in working with me, contact me! I'm always looking for Ludum Dare teammates.

## Website Updates

- **Prog 3** is now a whole subsection of the website, and has a bunch of new articles in it.
- **NextJS** is on the way, so the website will be a lot faster and more responsive.

## Plans for ~~world domination~~ Expansion

- **Threaded Posts** are in the works, and will allow pages like this to load several articles at once, and display them in a threaded format. This will allow me to write articles like this one, and have them all displayed on the same page, rather than having to make a new page for each one. Maybe I'll even hook an RSS feed up to it, who knows?
- **AI Generated Resume**. Instead of having some pdf download, I want to be able to have users select the skills they're interested in and have the resume dynamically update to show off those skills. OpenAI has a neat little API that might be able to help with this.
- **Spotify Listening History**, as nerdy as that sounds, is something I thought would be really neat to have. Maybe display my current song in the header, or show my listening history somewhere. Just something to show off my API skills.
