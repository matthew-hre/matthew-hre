# Welcome to My Blog

This is the first blog post on my website! It demonstrates the features available in the blog system.

## Features

The blog supports all standard markdown features, plus a few extras:

- **Syntax highlighting** for code blocks
- **GitHub-flavored markdown** (tables, strikethrough, task lists)
- **Automatic table of contents** generation
- **Image optimization** via Next.js Image component
- **Responsive typography** with Tailwind CSS

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting works out of the box with support for many languages:

```typescript
export function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const greeting = greet("World");
console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, World!
```

```javascript
const data = {
  title: "Blog Post",
  date: new Date(),
  published: true,
};
```
