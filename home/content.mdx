I'm a web developer, a graphic designer, and a student at [Mount Royal University](https://mtroyal.ca) in Calgary, Alberta. I make plenty of games, a few helpful tools, and – at the moment – lots of studying resources for students like myself.

I was previously the Executive Director of [MRUHacks 2024](https://mruhacks.ca), Mount Royal University's premier hackathon. Nowadays, I'm taking some much needed rest and relaxation, and focusing on my studies, my personal projects, and my record collection.
